# What is a Patent?

A patent is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a **process** that provides, in general, a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. To get a patent, technical information about the invention must be disclosed to the public in a patent application.


# Briefly describe your solution, focusing on the key technical aspects that you think are new and the advantages of your solution?

**RAMP** is a product that automates how and why requirements are applied to L2 processes. By codifying regulatory requirements into question-based logic, a process manager can answer 14 broad, binary yes/no questions, which lead to more questions based on those preliminary answers, to output which requirements apply to their process and must be controlled. Process Managers can leave feedback and dispute requirement applicability within RAMP,  and it allows Compliance Advisors to access this data and respond to disputes and make decisions before exporting and mapping to PRIME. The hundreds of questions currently in RAMP's logic are expanding as new requirements are created or changed, and can be rapidly and easily offered to process managers to drive and inform our weekly change governance forum. The product assigns requirements to processes with over 95% accuracy. In addition, the overall process to make the requirement applicability decision has reduced by 80%.

# Provide a brief overview of the problem that your invention solves.

Each year, there are hundreds of requirements that must be assessed for applicability to COAF's 59 L2 processes. The Manage Change Governance (MCG) team within COAF Business Risk office took on the challenge to solve three main problems:

1. The time it took to research a requirement
2. Determine which L2 process it would apply to
3. And have the process manager understand and agree to the applicability.

Normally, it took an average of two weeks per requirement. The team needed to reduce the time to establish applicability to an L2 process. Because these decisions were historically based on compliance advisor's opinion, the team needed to remove the subjectivity from the requirement applicability process, and ensure applicability was 100% right, 100% of the time. There was no official documentation of why a requirement applied to an L2 process. New process managers had to learn via tribal knowledge, and compliance and the MCG team had to remember conversations that had happened sometimes a couple of years in the past.
